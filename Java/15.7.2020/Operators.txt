Operators
	Operate on variables
	variables in terms of operators are called as operands

Assignment operator
	=
	helps us to assign value from right to left
	a=5
	value 5 is assigned to a i.e. value from right side assigned 	to left one

Arithmatic Operators
	+,-,/,*,%
	
	%=>modulus/modulo/mod->gives remainder after the division
	5/2=2	=>Quotient
	5%2=1	=>Remainder after division

Arithmatic assignment operators
	it performs arithmatic on one variable and stores the value 	back into same variable
	a=5
	a+=5	a=a+5	a=10
	a-=5	a=a-5	a=5
	a*=5	a=a*5	a=25
	a/=5	a=a/5	a=5
	a%=5	a=a%5	a=0

Comparison operators
	helps to perform comparison which will result into true or 	false
	
	>,<,>=,<=,==,!=
	== helps to check for equality
	!= checks if values are not equal

	a=5
	a==7	false
	a!=4	true
	
	this operators give boolean ans(true or false)
	a=7
	!(a==10)	true
	
	!(a!=8)		false

Logical operators
	helps us to check more than one conditions together

	AND(&&)	checks for affirmation of both condition
	C1	C2	Res
	T	T	T
	T	F	F
	F	T	F
	F	F	F

	OR(||) checks for affirmation of either condition
	C1	C2	Res
	T	T	T
	T	F	T
	F	T	T
	F	F	F

	NOT(!) 	Negates the result
	C1	Res
	T	F
	F	T

Unary Operators
	These operators work on single variable
	helps us to increment or decrement the value by 1
	a=5
	a++	a=a+1	a=6
	a--	a=a-1	a=5

	Post-increment(	First assignment then increment)
	x=5	y=8
	x=y++
	x=8	y=9

	Pre-increment(First increment then assignment)
	x=5	y=8
	x=++y
	x=9	y=9
